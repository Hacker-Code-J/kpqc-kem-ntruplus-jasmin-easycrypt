# kpqc-sig-ntruplus-jasmin-easycrypt

This repository is a workspace for developing and checking Jasmin and
EasyCrypt artifacts for NTRU+.

## NTRU+768 baseline

The imported NTRU+768 C reference implementation and KAT are rooted at
`NTRU+/NTRU+768` and `NTRU+/KAT/NTRU+768`. They byte-match the corresponding
trees at upstream NTRU+ commit
[`38201624477a7dbb2f46d1ae7686ae5ceee4eb80`](https://github.com/ntruplus/ntruplus/commit/38201624477a7dbb2f46d1ae7686ae5ceee4eb80).

Build the reference KEM, run its functional test, regenerate the deterministic
KAT, and compare it byte-for-byte with the imported response file:

```sh
./scripts/verify-ntruplus768-baseline.sh
```

## First verified slice: NTRU+768 `basemul`

The scalar Jasmin implementation at `ntruplus/jasmin/768/ref/basemul.jazz`
matches the defined signed-32-bit domain of
`NTRU+/NTRU+768/ntt.c::basemul`. The verification surface includes:

- Jasmin compilation and automatic memory-safety checking;
- cryptographic constant-time and speculative constant-time checking;
- deterministic C/Jasmin differential testing, including UBSan;
- reproducible `jasmin2ec` extraction; and
- an EasyCrypt total functional-correctness proof against an explicit
  word-level specification.

Run the complete slice check with:

```sh
./scripts/verify-ntruplus768-basemul.sh
```

The current EasyCrypt theorem covers exact word-level behavior of the isolated
four-coefficient kernel. It is not yet a proof of the modular
`Z_q[X]/(X^4-zeta)` semantics, the full polynomial multiplication, or the KEM.
The C/Jasmin correspondence also assumes distinct output and input buffers,
which is how the current `poly_basemul` call sites use the kernel.

## Formosa ML-KEM reference

The official
[`formosa-crypto/formosa-mlkem`](https://github.com/formosa-crypto/formosa-mlkem)
repository is pinned at `external/formosa-mlkem` as a Git submodule. It provides
reference Jasmin implementations and EasyCrypt proofs for ML-KEM, including
security, specification, correctness, safety, and constant-time artifacts.

The Formosa material is included as an external reference corpus. Its
verification results apply to ML-KEM and do not establish any property of
NTRU+. NTRU+ specifications, implementations, and proofs must be developed and
verified separately.

Clone this repository with all nested dependencies:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules \
  https://github.com/Hacker-Code-J/kpqc-sig-ntruplus-jasmin-easycrypt.git
```

For an existing clone, initialize the pinned submodules with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The upstream build and proof-checking requirements are documented in
`external/formosa-mlkem/README.md`. In particular, the upstream project pins a
development Jasmin compiler and requires a compatible EasyCrypt installation
with Z3 and CVC5. Once those prerequisites are available, its top-level proof
check is:

```sh
make -C external/formosa-mlkem check
```
