# kpqc-sig-ntruplus-jasmin-easycrypt

This repository is a workspace for developing and checking Jasmin and
EasyCrypt artifacts for NTRU+.

## NTRU+768 baseline

The imported NTRU+768 C reference implementation and KAT are rooted at
`NTRU+/NTRU+768` and `NTRU+/KAT/NTRU+768`. They byte-match the corresponding
trees at upstream NTRU+ commit
[`38201624477a7dbb2f46d1ae7686ae5ceee4eb80`](https://github.com/ntruplus/ntruplus/commit/38201624477a7dbb2f46d1ae7686ae5ceee4eb80).

Build the reference KEM, run its functional test, regenerate the deterministic
KAT, and compare it byte-for-byte with the imported response file:

```sh
./scripts/verify-ntruplus768-baseline.sh
```

## First verified slice: NTRU+768 `basemul`

The scalar Jasmin implementation at `ntruplus/jasmin/768/ref/basemul.jazz`
matches the defined signed-32-bit domain of
`NTRU+/NTRU+768/ntt.c::basemul`. The verification surface includes:

- Jasmin compilation and automatic memory-safety checking;
- cryptographic constant-time and speculative constant-time checking;
- deterministic C/Jasmin differential testing, including UBSan;
- reproducible `jasmin2ec` extraction; and
- an EasyCrypt total functional-correctness proof against an explicit
  word-level specification, followed by a mathematical quotient-ring bridge.

Run the complete slice check with:

```sh
./scripts/verify-ntruplus768-basemul.sh
```

The EasyCrypt proof is split into two layers. The first covers exact word-level
behavior of the isolated four-coefficient kernel. The second interprets signed
words as integers and proves the four coefficient congruences for multiplication
in `Z_q[X]/(X^4-zeta)`, with `q = 3457`. The bridge assumes every input
coefficient and the supplied twiddle lie in `[-q, q)`, and that the supplied
twiddle represents the mathematical `zeta` in Montgomery form. It also proves
that each result lies in `[-q, q)`.

This does not yet prove that every caller establishes those range and twiddle
preconditions or the KEM. The C/Jasmin correspondence also assumes distinct
output and input buffers, which is how the current `poly_basemul` call sites
use the kernel.

## Full verified slice: NTRU+768 `poly_basemul`

The scalar Jasmin implementation at `ntruplus/jasmin/768/ref/poly_basemul.jazz`
matches the full 96-iteration `NTRU+/NTRU+768/poly.c::poly_basemul` loop at the
word level. Each iteration consumes one twiddle from `zetas[96..191]` and
applies two four-coefficient `basemul` blocks, first with `zeta` and then with
`-zeta`, covering all 192 four-coefficient blocks in the 768-coefficient
polynomial.

Run the complete loop check with:

```sh
./scripts/verify-ntruplus768-poly-basemul.sh
```

The EasyCrypt development for this slice is again split into two layers. The
word-level proof shows exact agreement with the extracted Jasmin procedure for
all 96 iterations. The algebra layer lifts each of the 192 output blocks into
`Z_q[X]/(X^4-zeta_k)` using the shared NTRU+768 NTT schedule theorem described
below. Its only remaining data precondition is that every input coefficient
lies in `[-q, q)`.

Under that assumption, every output coefficient is again in `[-q, q)`, and
each block satisfies the expected four coefficient congruences modulo `q = 3457`.

## First executable forward-NTT slice: initial split

The scalar Jasmin procedure at `ntruplus/jasmin/768/ref/ntt_stage1.jazz`
implements the first loop of `NTRU+/NTRU+768/ntt.c::ntt`. It consumes
`zetas[1] = -1033` and transforms all 384 pairs `(a[i], a[i+384])`. A
fail-closed source checker pins the C twiddle index and butterfly data flow to
the standalone Jasmin slice, and its self-check rejects representative twiddle,
index, and sign mutations.

Run the complete initial-split check with:

```sh
./scripts/verify-ntruplus768-ntt-stage1.sh
```

The check covers reproducible `jasmin2ec` extraction, exact word-level
functional correctness, losslessness, Jasmin safety, CT and SCT analysis, and
C-oracle differential tests over 8 boundary and 4096 deterministic random
vectors. The differential suite exercises both distinct buffers and the
in-place call shape used by the reference transform.

The algebra layer connects `-1033` to schedule entry 1 and therefore to the
mathematical root `zeta_root^96`. Assuming every input coefficient is in
`[-q, q)`, it proves the two butterfly congruences modulo `q = 3457`. It also
proves the explicit bounds `[-2q, 2q)` for the low half and `[-3q, 3q)` for
the high half, providing the range contract needed by the next transform
layer.

This slice is deliberately only the initial cyclotomic split. It does not yet
include the following radix-3 layer, the five radix-2 layers, their composition
into the complete forward transform, or `invntt`. The EasyCrypt model proves
array-value behavior; in-place pointer aliasing is covered by Jasmin's safety
check and the machine-level differential suite rather than a separate formal
aliasing theorem.

## Executable forward-NTT radix-3 layer

The in-place scalar procedure at `ntruplus/jasmin/768/ref/ntt_radix3.jazz`
implements the second loop of `NTRU+/NTRU+768/ntt.c::ntt`. Its two 128-lane
blocks consume `zetas[2..5] = {-682, -248, -708, 682}` and use
`NTRUPLUS_OMEGA = -886`. The standalone boundary accepts the widened output of
the initial split instead of duplicating the already verified stage-1 code.

Run the complete radix-3 check with:

```sh
./scripts/verify-ntruplus768-ntt-radix3.sh
```

The check covers reproducible extraction, exact word-level correctness and
losslessness, Jasmin safety, CT and SCT analysis, and fail-closed coupling to
the C twiddle order and butterfly data flow. Differential and UBSan tests cover
10 boundary vectors, 4096 direct radix-3 vectors, and 2048 vectors chained
through the Jasmin stage-1 slice; the chained suite exercises both the original
disjoint stage-1 call and its in-place caller shape.

The algebra layer ties the four twiddles to root exponents `32`, `64`, `160`,
and `320`, and ties `OMEGA` to exponent `192`. Assuming the stage-1 contract
(`[-2q,2q)` on indices below 384 and `[-3q,3q)` on the upper half), it proves
the Montgomery input bounds, the three radix-3 butterfly congruences for every
triple, and exact signed output bounds `[-4q,4q)` for the first block and
`[-5q,5q)` for the second.

This layer remains a standalone in-place array-value theorem. A later
composition theorem will connect it with stage 1 and the remaining five
radix-2 layers into a complete forward transform.

## Verified NTRU+768 NTT root schedule

The shared EasyCrypt theory at
`ntruplus/proof/768/ref/ntt_schedule/NTRUPlus768NTTSchedule.ec` proves that the
explicit complete signed `zetas[192]` table and transform constants encode the
NTRU+ specification's recursive factorization schedule. For `q = 3457`, it
proves that `22` has exact order `576`, generates the terminal exponents from
the initial radix-2 layer, one radix-3 layer, and five standard radix-2 layers,
and matches all 192 Figure 22 indices. It also proves that:

- every concrete table entry is the centered Montgomery encoding of the
  corresponding power of the root;
- the exponents represented by `zetas[96..191]`, interleaved with their
  order-2 shifts, match the 192 terminal roots used by the `X^4-zeta_i`
  blocks;
- every terminal root satisfies `Y^192-Y^96+1 = 0` modulo `q`;
- the `OMEGA`, `ZMINUSZ5INV`, `NINV`, and `2NINV` constants have their stated
  Montgomery meanings.

The parser-based verification layer ties those explicit values to
`NTRU+/NTRU+768/ntt.c` and separately checks that the forward and reverse C
loops consume exactly the intended table ranges.

Run the schedule proof and the independent parser-based check of the C table,
constants, and loop bounds with:

```sh
./scripts/verify-ntruplus768-ntt-schedule.sh
```

This milestone still does not prove:

- that upstream callers establish the signed-range preconditions for every call;
- the five radix-2 executable layers, composition of all verified layers into
  the complete forward `ntt`, or an executable `invntt` implementing the
  proved inverse schedule; or
- key generation, encryption, or the full KEM.

## Formosa ML-KEM reference

The official
[`formosa-crypto/formosa-mlkem`](https://github.com/formosa-crypto/formosa-mlkem)
repository is pinned at `external/formosa-mlkem` as a Git submodule. It provides
reference Jasmin implementations and EasyCrypt proofs for ML-KEM, including
security, specification, correctness, safety, and constant-time artifacts.

The Formosa material is included as an external reference corpus. The NTRU+768
basemul and forward-NTT algebra bridges reuse its generic signed-Montgomery
theory and word arithmetic lemmas, then instantiate and prove the
NTRU+-specific constants, bounds, schedule, and quotient-ring semantics
locally. Formosa's ML-KEM verification results do not establish any property
of NTRU+.

Clone this repository with all nested dependencies:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules \
  https://github.com/Hacker-Code-J/kpqc-sig-ntruplus-jasmin-easycrypt.git
```

For an existing clone, initialize the pinned submodules with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The upstream build and proof-checking requirements are documented in
`external/formosa-mlkem/README.md`. In particular, the upstream project pins a
development Jasmin compiler and requires a compatible EasyCrypt installation
with Z3 and CVC5. Once those prerequisites are available, its top-level proof
check is:

```sh
make -C external/formosa-mlkem check
```
